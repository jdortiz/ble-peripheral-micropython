# BLE Peripheral

## This Repo

This repository contains code for a BLE Peripheral written in MicroPython.  The code is meant for a Raspberry Pi Pico
(RP2) W and produces a fake temperature that is shared via BLE.  Later, the plan is to read the on-board sensor and
provides the data using BLE.

## Edit and run

This code uses [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) and it is meant to be run in the RP2. I have used VSCode with the
[MicroPico](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) extension. If you choose to use this
option (instead of any other editor, like proper Emacs, with [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell), or the
default [Thonny](https://thonny.org/)), please run "MicroPico: Configure Project" to run it from the editor.
